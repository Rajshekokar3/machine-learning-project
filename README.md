# Mushroom Classification Project
This project analyzes a dataset of hypothetical mushroom samples from the Agaricus and Lepiota family. The dataset includes descriptions of 23 species and classifies them as either:

Definitely edible
Definitely poisonous
Unknown edibility (combined with the poisonous class)
The analysis applies machine learning techniques to predict the edibility of mushrooms based on their physical and ecological characteristics.

# License Dataset
The dataset is sourced from The Audubon Society Field Guide to North American Mushrooms (1981). It contains categorical features describing the characteristics of mushrooms, such as cap shape, surface texture, odor, and habitat.

# Objective
The primary goal is to classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using machine learning models.

# Techniques Used
This project involves:

Data preprocessing using Pandas and NumPy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Feature encoding with LabelEncoder.
Machine learning models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
k-Nearest Neighbors
Evaluation metrics:
Accuracy Score
F1 Score
